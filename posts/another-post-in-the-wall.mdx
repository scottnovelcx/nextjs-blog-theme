AgileAILabs is about to launch a revolutionary software platform that will enable agile teams to take control of two of the largest challenges that affect teams today: Requirements and Test Cases. The tool we are preparing for rollout (Spec2Test AI) allows teams to analyze and greatly enhance their project requirements with advanced AI models and then allows for the automatic generation of test cases from those enhanced requirements. This results in an acceleration of the agile lifecycle and time to delivery/market, but more importantly it greatly increases the level of quality of the assets the agile team is working with. Enhanced requirements and automatically generated test cases that are based in mathematical models that have been used as the gold standard for test case development for decades will ensure much better product outcomes while lowering delivery costs and significantly reducing the cost of poor quality across a company's project portfolio.
